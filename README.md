# Continuous Walsh sampling and wavelet reconstruction (CWW)
This software implements the change of basis matrix between a Walsh sampling basis and orthonormal wavelet reconstruction basis using fast transforms in one and two dimensions. It is accompanied by numerous easy examples. 

## Dependencies
* [SPGL1](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mpf/spgl1/) A solver for large-scale sparse reconstruction
* [Fastwht](https://bitbucket.org/vegarant/fastwht/) A fast implementation of
  of matlabs `fwht`-function and an implementation of the Walsh function
  support.
* [WL - General purpose wavelet library](https://github.com/oyvindry/wl/tree/new_interface) Wavelet library for boundary wavelet support. Note that the branch `new_interface` is used.
